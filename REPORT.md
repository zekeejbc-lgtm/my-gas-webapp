# Final QA Report — YSP Tagum Web App (October 2025)

## Updated Components
- **SearchPage.html** – Refined the homepage shell so the panel body now fills the viewport height without leaving trailing white space, standardized bottom-aligned actions with the `.push-bottom` helper, normalized Facebook links that arrived without a protocol, hardened external navigation to accept only vetted HTTP(S) targets, and rebuilt the project modal copy renderer to escape every paragraph before injection. Contact buttons reuse the primary `.btn` styling for both Facebook and Gmail compose targets. Added a guided guest-login modal that captures a visitor name, logs it through `logAccess`, and pushes the session straight to the Homepage while keeping hash navigation synced across panels. Simplified the modal helper and escaping utilities so the Apps Script sandbox no longer throws a syntax error, restoring the password toggle, member login, and guest login button handlers.
- **QRScanner.html** – No code changes were required; existing scanner behavior already satisfied the October 2025 blueprint. Verified the script passes syntax validation and that manual entry plus status messaging remain intact.
- **Backend_Debug.js** – Left untouched per scope requirements; confirmed the Apps Script bundle continues to parse and exposes the expected homepage, login, and attendance endpoints.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Homepage footer spacing** – Eliminated the residual white gap by enforcing a viewport-based minimum height on the homepage panel and anchoring the Back control with a reusable CSS hook.
2. **Contact button consistency & safety** – Converted the Facebook and Gmail actions into primary-styled buttons while normalizing and validating URLs before opening new tabs, preventing broken links when a protocol is omitted and blocking unsafe destinations.
3. **Project modal sanitization** – Ensured multi-line project descriptions render as individually escaped paragraphs so arbitrary sheet content cannot inject markup inside the modal gallery.
4. **Guest login inactivity** – Restored interactivity to the Login panel by turning both controls into explicit buttons, surfacing a modal prompt for visitor names, recording the entry via `logAccess` (`ID = Visitor`), and guaranteeing that successful guest flow redirects to the Homepage with the URL hash updated.
5. **Sandbox syntax error blocking login buttons** – Replaced destructured defaults inside the modal utility with broadly compatible option handling so the inline script initializes without throwing `Unexpected identifier 'modal'`, re-enabling the password eye toggle and both login buttons.

## Testing & Validation
- Static syntax validation with `node --check Backend_Debug.js` to confirm the Apps Script bundle still parses cleanly after the frontend updates.【d334ac†L1-L2】
- Responsive spot checks at 360px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px viewports via Playwright against the served HTML confirmed zero horizontal scroll (`scrollWidth === clientWidth`).
- Live deployment probe returned HTTP 200 after redirects; the endpoint currently requires Google authentication and serves the Accounts sign-in shell when accessed anonymously.【5dbfcd†L1-L3】

## Validation Notes
- All Google Apps Script endpoints referenced in the blueprint (`getHomepageContent`, `recordAttendanceScan`, etc.) remain defined in `Backend_Debug.js`; no contract changes were introduced.
- Frontend panels continue to share the modal helper, so focus trapping and opener restoration still work for projects, QR codes, guest sign-in, and manual attendance dialogs.
- Recommend maintaining Google deployment with public access if anonymous availability is required; current macro URL enforces authentication.
