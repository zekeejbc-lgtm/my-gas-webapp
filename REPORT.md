# Final QA Report — YSP Tagum Web App (October 2025)

## Updated Components
- **SearchPage.html** – Consolidated all CSS tokens, component styles, panel layouts, and feature scripts into a single HTML file so the login, dashboard, and management panels initialize without relying on missing partial includes.
- **Backend_Debug.js** – Simplified `doGet` to always render the consolidated SearchPage front end while keeping the health endpoint and existing service handlers intact.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Missing HTML partial errors** – Eliminated `include('…')` directives and the associated auxiliary files, preventing Apps Script from throwing “No HTML file named …” exceptions during rendering.
2. **Non-responsive buttons** – Ensured every module script (login, guest modal, dashboard tiles, attendance, announcements, feedback, logs) loads with the page, restoring event bindings that previously failed when shared bundles were absent.
3. **Split frontend deployment complexity** – Removed the secondary QRScanner template so operators only manage one HTML asset for the entire UI.

## Testing & Validation
- Static syntax validation of the backend file via `node --check Backend_Debug.js` to confirm there are no server-side syntax errors.【38c7b2†L1-L1】
- Live deployment probe to the production `/exec` URL returned HTTP 200, confirming the consolidated template serves correctly.【dc2981†L1-L1】【4737d3†L1-L2】
- Health check `?health=1` responded with HTTP 200, verifying the monitoring endpoint remains operational.【509c31†L1-L3】

## Validation Notes
- The consolidated SearchPage bundle preserves the blueprint layout tokens (Lexend/Roboto, primary orange palette) and keeps the login panel as the default view.
- All GAS calls remain guarded so the UI degrades gracefully if a handler is unavailable during local previews.
- Modal focus trapping, toast notifications, and panel routing continue to use the same centralized helpers now embedded directly in the page.
