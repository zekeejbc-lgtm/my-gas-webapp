# Final QA Report — YSP Tagum Web App (October 2025)

## Updated Components
- **SearchPage.html** – Replaced the modal helper with ES5-friendly DOM assembly (plain `var`, `onclick`) so the Apps Script HTML Service no longer throws `Unexpected identifier 'modal'`, refreshed fallback imagery with `placehold.co`, and confirmed all login/guest actions wire up after `DOMContentLoaded` with the existing startup log.
- **QRScanner.html** – Revalidated the DOMContentLoaded IIFE; no new source edits required this round.
- **Backend_Debug.js** – Interface audit only; endpoints remain blueprint-compliant.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Sandbox parse failure** – Removing module-era constructs from the modal helper stops the inline script from aborting before button listeners register.
2. **Broken placeholder imagery** – Switching to `placehold.co` and running URLs through `safeImageUrl` prevents `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` when Sheets omit media links.
3. **Event wiring regression risk** – Retested DOMContentLoaded wiring to ensure login, guest, and modal buttons stay interactive after the compatibility rewrite.

## Testing & Validation
- Static syntax validation of all inline scripts with `node --check` on the SearchPage, QRScanner, and backend bundles.【0797b9†L1-L8】【c04672†L1-L9】
- Live deployment probe confirmed the published `/exec` endpoint responds with HTTP 200.【53d40a†L1-L3】
- Manual responsive sweep via temporary HTTP server plus Playwright viewports (360px–1440px) verified centered panels, functional modals, and intact focus management after the rewrite.

## Validation Notes
- Required Apps Script endpoints (`getHomepageContent`, `recordAttendanceScan`, etc.) remain unchanged in `Backend_Debug.js`.
- Modal focus is restored to trigger elements after dismissal, and guest login still records visitor entries through `logAccess`.
- Desktop and mobile previews captured for regression documentation (see responsive checklist).
