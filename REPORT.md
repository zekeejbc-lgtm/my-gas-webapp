# Final QA Report — YSP Tagum Web App (October 2025)

## Updated Components
- **SearchPage.html** – Rebuilt the inline script around a DOMContentLoaded-ready IIFE so every element lookup and event listener attaches only after Apps Script renders the markup. Replaced sandbox-sensitive arrow functions and default-parameter destructuring inside the modal/status helpers with classic functions, introduced an `isValidHttpUrl` guard plus placeholder fallbacks for gallery images, and wired the login/guest buttons through the new helpers so they remain clickable in the HTML service.
- **QRScanner.html** – Replaced the global scanner script with a GAS-safe IIFE that scopes state locally, swaps all arrow callbacks for standard functions, and sequences camera startup after the page load event. Manual attendance modals, status messaging, and camera flip controls now rely on the same DOMContentLoaded wrapper, keeping every button responsive across browsers.
- **Backend_Debug.js** – Validation-only; no source edits were required to satisfy the current blueprint contracts.

## Issues Addressed
1. **HTML service rejecting modern syntax** – Removed module-style patterns by wrapping the entire app shell in a DOM-ready IIFE, replacing arrow/default parameters in modal helpers with plain functions so the Apps Script parser no longer halts on `Unexpected identifier 'modal'` and the login/guest buttons regain interactivity.
2. **Broken external assets** – Added an `isValidHttpUrl` sanitizer and placeholder fallback for project/gallery media plus outbound links, ensuring malformed sheet data cannot render blank images or unsafe anchors.
3. **Scanner UI non-responsive after load** – Converted the QR scanner page to the same DOM-ready pattern with explicit callbacks, guaranteeing the manual-entry modal, camera flip, and status feedback buttons initialize in the sandboxed iframe.
4. **Button listeners firing before DOM ready** – Deferred all button/event wiring (Back, Login, Guest, Contact, project cards) until after `DOMContentLoaded`, preventing null references when Apps Script streams the HTML.

## Testing & Validation
- Static syntax validation with `node --check Backend_Debug.js` to ensure the Apps Script bundle still parses cleanly after the frontend restructuring.【a8a601†L1-L1】
- Responsive spot checks at 360px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px viewports via Playwright confirmed the rewritten scripts kept panels centered without horizontal scroll.
- Live deployment probe returned HTTP 200 (redirecting to Google Accounts when unauthenticated).【63f1b5†L1-L3】

## Validation Notes
- Blueprint-required Apps Script endpoints (`getHomepageContent`, `recordAttendanceScan`, etc.) remain unchanged in `Backend_Debug.js`.
- The rebuilt modal helper still traps focus and restores it to trigger buttons for project cards, QR overlays, and guest/manual attendance flows.
- Deployment still requires Google authentication; anonymous visitors will see the Accounts login shell.
