# Final QA Report — YSP Tagum Web App (October 2025)

## Updated Components
- **SearchPage.html** – Routed the shared helper include through the server-side `include()` hook, added inline fallbacks for `YSP.modal`/`YSP.openExternal`, and tightened `callServer` so login/guest buttons keep working even when the sandbox trims shared helpers or endpoints momentarily misconfigure.
- **QRScanner.html** – Revalidated the DOMContentLoaded IIFE; no new source edits required this round.
- **Backend_Debug.js** – Interface audit only; endpoints remain blueprint-compliant.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Template directive leaking to DOM** – Using `include('Shared')` keeps helper markup from rendering as plain text behind the login panel, restoring the intended layout.
2. **Modal helper crash** – Injecting ES5 fallbacks for `YSP.modal` and `YSP.openExternal` prevents the sandbox from halting execution when the shared bundle fails to load, allowing buttons to bind reliably.
3. **Mock-only server routing** – `callServer` now surfaces missing endpoint errors instead of silently dropping into mocks, so login/attendance buttons consistently talk to production GAS services.

## Testing & Validation
- Static syntax validation of all inline scripts with `node --check` on the SearchPage, QRScanner, and backend bundles.【0797b9†L1-L8】【c04672†L1-L9】
- Live deployment probe confirmed the published `/exec` endpoint responds with HTTP 200.【53d40a†L1-L3】
- Manual responsive sweep via temporary HTTP server plus Playwright viewports (360px–1440px) verified centered panels, functional modals, and intact focus management after the rewrite.

## Validation Notes
- Required Apps Script endpoints (`getHomepageContent`, `recordAttendanceScan`, etc.) remain unchanged in `Backend_Debug.js`.
- Modal focus is restored to trigger elements after dismissal, and guest login still records visitor entries through `logAccess`.
- Desktop and mobile previews captured for regression documentation (see responsive checklist).
