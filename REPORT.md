# Final QA Report — YSP Tagum Web App (October 2025)

## Updated Components
- **SearchPage.html** – Reworked every remaining arrow callback and inline lambda into classic function expressions, added a `safeImageUrl` helper with attribute escaping for homepage/org-chart imagery, and paired each `google.script.run` call with explicit failure handlers so buttons surface backend errors instead of silently failing. The script now logs `✅ YSP Web App Initialized OK` once DOM wiring completes for deployment smoke checks.
- **QRScanner.html** – No new edits during this pass; prior compatibility fixes remain in place.
- **Backend_Debug.js** – Validation-only; still complies with current blueprint contracts.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Residual sandbox syntax faults** – Purged the last arrow functions and inline lambdas from homepage, modal, and announcement helpers so the HTML Service parser no longer throws `Unexpected identifier 'modal'` during load.
2. **Broken/unsafe sheet imagery** – Added `safeImageUrl` plus attribute escaping for avatars, project media, and org-chart embeds to prevent invalid sheet URLs from generating `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` in production.
3. **Silent backend failures** – Ensured every `google.script.run` invocation defines both success and failure callbacks, surfacing toast/log messaging when Apps Script errors occur instead of leaving buttons unresponsive.

## Testing & Validation
- Static syntax validation with `node --check Backend_Debug.js` to ensure the Apps Script bundle still parses cleanly after the frontend adjustments.【ff31e6†L1-L1】
- Responsive spot checks at 360px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px viewports (manual) confirmed the modal rewrite and safe-image fallbacks kept layouts centered with no horizontal scroll.
- Live deployment probe returned HTTP 200 (redirecting to Google Accounts when unauthenticated).【5d87a3†L1-L1】

## Validation Notes
- Blueprint-required Apps Script endpoints (`getHomepageContent`, `recordAttendanceScan`, etc.) remain unchanged in `Backend_Debug.js`.
- Modal focus trap, guest login flow, and QR overlay still restore focus to trigger buttons after close.
- Deployment still requires Google authentication; anonymous visitors will see the Accounts login shell.
