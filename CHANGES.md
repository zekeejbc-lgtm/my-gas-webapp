# Change Log

## SearchPage.html
- Introduced spacing tokens, gradient overlay, and `.panel-header`/`.panel-body` wrappers so every panel centers cleanly with balanced padding and internal scroll containment.
- Replaced ad-hoc inline styles with utility classes (`.form-stack`, `.panel-actions`, `.media-stack`, `.info-grid`, `.directory-result`) that keep avatars, cards, and action groups aligned across breakpoints.
- Upgraded the officer search field into an accessible combobox: keyboard navigation highlights `.suggestion-item`s, ARIA attributes stay in sync, and empty states show friendly messaging.
- Updated the QR session bootstrapper to call `getSession()` safely (with failure logging) so returning users can be restored when the backend supports it.

## QRScanner.html
- Restyled the scanner shell with a frosted header, descriptive subtitle, and centered action group while the gradient backdrop now includes a soft overlay to remove dead space.
- Added a Flip Camera control (hidden when unnecessary) and resize-aware `computeQrBox()` logic so the preview adapts after orientation or viewport changes without user refreshes.
- Reworked `showStatus` to drive `data-state` attributes, seed an “Initializing camera…” placeholder, and preserve persistent error messaging.
- Maintained the accessible manual entry modal while aligning its palette, spacing, and button stacking with the refreshed card.

## Backend_Debug.js
- Updated `doGet` to route between the main search experience and QR scanner via the `page` query parameter while keeping viewport metadata consistent.
- Added `getQrScannerUrl()` so the frontend can open the deployed scanner in a new tab using the script's public URL.
- Persisted the last successful login in `PropertiesService` and exposed `getSession()` so the frontend can restore authenticated users without re-entering credentials.


## REPORT.md
- Updated feature breakdowns, CSS analysis, and visual previews to describe the new panel structure, keyboard-enabled suggestions, flip-camera support, and session persistence.
