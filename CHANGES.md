- Implemented the blueprint homepage layout: container-based sections, project gallery card grid, split contact cards, and a back-to-login control so the panel fills the viewport without lingering whitespace.
- Added UI tokens for `.container`, cards, buttons, and the redesigned modal system (backdrop, focus-trapped panel, 16:9 media wrappers) to satisfy accessibility, animation, and responsive requirements.
- Rebuilt `loadHomepage()` to sanitize sheet data, derive project pairs when the array is missing, validate URLs before opening Facebook/Gmail compose actions, and surface resilient offline/error states.
- Introduced safe helper utilities (`textOrEmpty`, `isSafeHttpUrl`, `buildGmailComposeUrl`, `openExternal`) plus hash-aware `switchPanels()` updates so navigation, action buttons, and modal focus restoration behave consistently across roles and devices.
